-> Texto do comentario: "Forget what everyone else says, this movie was great. I laughed every 10 seconds and it was like watching Scary Movie 5, 
except without scary movie parodies. The parodies are creative and hilarious, and this movie deserves a 10, if you haven't seen it, 
see it. Give it a chance, I thought it was a great movie and you should defiantly see it!!!! Excellent use of 
"Fergielicious" in the movie as well. Great jokes along the way, and I can't watch Chronicles of Narnia without cracking up. I 
went into this movie as a last second thing to do on a Friday night, and I thought it would suck. But 
I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be using Epic Movie terms for a long time now. Long live Jack Swallows!!!!!!!!".

-> Texto do comentario: "OK maybe not the artistic triumph of all time but it was fun, it was interesting enough to keep us watching all 
the way through (3 times) and it was a movie that depended on more than one person to make it work. Alan 
Cummings was alternately scary and touching and the father character 'Tim' was very believable. The underlying theme of the importance of the 
bond between fathers and sons was well done without ever getting slushy. The 'gloopy' bits quite honestly compared with some of the 
gross-out material presented these days on children's cartoon channels was extremely mild and never revolting. The sets were beautiful, and the CGI 
was absolutely fine. This film had a good pacey storyline, amusing sympathetic characters and plenty of laugh out loud moments. I can 
see why Carrey fans wouldn't like it, but as I am not a Carrey fan and prefer a balanced film with an 
ensemble of good acting and a share out of amusing lines, rather than a one man ego trip with a back up 
of lacklustre characters none of whom can steal the star's thunder - I enjoyed this film. Alan Cummings was a joy and 
it is nice to watch an actor of his calibre doing what he does best, entertaining and interacting with the other cast 
members to produce a great film. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have a fun time when watching a 
film and who enjoys surreal wacky stuff. If you like 'Fairly Odd Parents' 'My Parents are Aliens' 'Tom and Jerry' and 'Coneheads' 
you will probably enjoy this.".

-> Texto do comentario: "First off, this movie is nowhere near Romero's classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, but it doesn't intend to be, it does 
exactly what it intends to do, be FUN! And boy is it ever fun, when a group of misguided teens explore an 
evil island infested with the LIVING DEAD! Uwe Boll did a good job, I honestly don't see why people trash this guy. 
It's nowhere near Boll's ALONE IN THE DARK, which is a much better film, but this is zombie fighting fun at it's 
finest, my friends. I really enjoyed this movie and I say that honestly. I certainly hope we can expect more from Uwe 
in the future. 10/10 ~ Wulfus".

-> Texto do comentario: "I don't even remember how I stumbled on this movie I missed on its 2008 release two weeks ago March 21, but 
on reading its reviews and finding most to be as bad as they are, I had to see it for myself. I 
thus ordered it March 27, received it two days ago and have been a laughing at it all weekend! Paris Hilton was 
not the star of this comedy-fest from the beginning; Joel David Moore steals that designation as the fool-in-love geek out to claim 
the girl of his dreams that he hadn't seen since the first grade! Whoooo--ooh! I'm still laughing at the irony of such 
an unsightly guy being fed on how to gain the hand of the lovely and still single Cristobel from his fat geeky 
(and equally-named) friend Arno Blount, who has no girlfriend and lives with his presumed widowed decorator mother from another era Mrs. Blount 
in a blunt-trauma-to-the-head relationship smacking of son-worship! Writer was dead-on on this one: although I understand why it only brought $27,000+ U.S. 
box-office on its 2008 release! Being it that a person with bad teeth would not warrant the $27 value of a slave 
to the master who would not want to pay for the parents' negligence or disease, why is it that in this movie, 
writer Heidi Ferrer who did not do her research, went to great pains to show us how it was that Joel Moore's 
character of Nate Cooper fell in love with Paris Hilton's character of Cristobel Abbott in the first grade where her lifelong friendship 
with Christine Lakin's character of the repugnant June Phigg began but gave us no detail as to how it was that June 
was as equally repulsive twenty years later at twenty six? Was she born to parents in a hospital or hatched in a 
car trunk amidst a nest of chickens and raised thusly? Because for a woman to have alopecia, skin lesions, a hideous carbuncle 
on her chin with a whisker growing out of it, a disease-blackened toenail, no muscle tone in her entire body, no dress 
sense whatsoever and teeth as misaligned and rotted as June's in a statement she hadn't seen a dentist since they came in 
that way at age eleven, both her mother and her father implicated for criminal negligence and ruination of their daughter that could 
only get her a minimum-wage job after high school graduation at the city zoo cutting up raw fish to feed the animals 
or cleaning up toilets, if that, should both have been stabbed, shot, strangled, bludgeoned, quartered, eaten and then vomited back and flushed 
down any toilet that June left to go though life with a mouth as messed up as hers could not have gotten 
hired to clean up! I mean, even Johann Urb as the buff dentist that came to the rescue and took interest in 
correcting June's teeth caught Nate in his greatly detailed lie about having no pilot's license but taking children up in his plane 
and flying them recklessly for sport, which would be criminal negligence on the part of any UNLICENSED pilot! Martin Lawrence did the 
rotten-teeth thing with his mock character of "player" Jerome to repugnant perfection in his 1990s TV show "Martin," but what woman ever 
dated Jerome? Not even Lawrence's brusque-spoken braid-sporting hard-voiced hairdresser alter-ego character of Shenaynay could have been paid the value of her salon 
to date Jerome! Perhaps had Ferrer factored into her script that June's parents and family had been murdered or abandoned her and 
June had been thrown away and thus left with the mess of her lack of beauty to correct on her own with 
no means to do so because no one would have dealings with anyone that physically repulsive, all who had hated this movie 
as the worst crime to be committed against an audience would have COMMISERATED with her misfortune and then derived HUMOR from all 
the funny shtick and lies ugly-duckling-geek himself Nate carried out to get her a date with a man little better than him 
in order to get next to Cristobel! And while the ending explained how it was that Nate suddenly found himself falling for 
June after her transformation from "nottie" to likely, not very many a guy with a no-name job or known salary would drive 
a loser car that wouldn't have made it to his home state line 3,000 miles across the U.S. and then offer to 
pay a guy $1,500.00 to date a cold-ugly woman in order to get next to her hot-gorgeous best friend holding out on 
every guy hitting her up to that endand with the "hottie" friend having made no effort to beautify her "nottie" best-friend- since-the-first-grade 
in TWENTY YEARS! And how Christine Lakin, beautiful tomboy daughter "Al" from the 1990s TV show "Step-By-Step" managed to work her jaws, 
lips and tongue around the awful prosthetics the makeup department fitted over her perfect teeth in order for her to speak as 
naturally as she did and let herself be laughed at in this hideous ugly-duckling-turned-incredibly- beautiful-swan mock-romantic comedy is beyond me—as the TRUE 
star in this satire, she should have taken home an award!".

-> Texto do comentario: "This movie should be included in film school textbooks under "how to make a bad movie". I own 2 copies of this 
classic (the MST3k DVD, and the normal movie) and enjoy both of them. It's not exactly gone with the wind, but the 
"sucks so bad it's good" factor of this film will give Ed Wood's best a run for it's money. Wild cuts, horrible 
voice overs, bad acting, and a 6 minute intro that's nothing but someone driving with background music are just a few of 
the wonderful moments you have to look forward to. Bottom line if you don't want to watch a bad movie , then 
stay away from this film. If however, you're morbidly curious enough to seek to answer the question "Just how bad can a 
movie be" then give it a try.".
